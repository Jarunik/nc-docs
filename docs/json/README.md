# JSON

You can use https://app.steemconnect.com/sign to try out the custom JSON's.

## Structure

A custom_json command consists of an id and a json field. All commands in nextcolony have the same id:

```nextcolony```

and the json field has the following structure:

```json
{"username":"holger80","type":"newuser","command":{"tr_var1":"holger80"}}
```

where `username` is the username (currently not used and can be skipped).
type defines the command `type` and `command` consists of a dict with the keys `tr_var1` to `tr_var8`.
The command is applied to the user defined in the `required_posting_auths` field.

## newuser

```json
{"username":"holger80","type":"newuser","command":{"tr_var1":"holger80"}}
```

Creates a new game account with the steem account name.
The command uses one field:

- `tr_var1`: steem username
